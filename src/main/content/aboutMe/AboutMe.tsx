        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I've been studying for a Bachelor's in Software Engineering at Fontys University of Applied Sciences in Eindhoven since September 2020, and expect to graduate in July 2024. </p>
        <p>I'm following the Software Engineering profile of the ICT study, covering full-stack development of large-scale applications, taking scalability, security, and maintainability into account. We make use of a wide variety of languages and technologies, depending on which suit the project best. This means that I have a broad range of experience, and that I can adapt quickly to new technologies and environments.</p>
        <p>Besides this main profile, I've taken a specialisation semester in AI, covering data science and the implementation of a wide variety of machine learning models, and I plan to take the Advanced AI semester as my minor, covering neural networks, convolutional networks, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.</p>
        <p>During my first internship at Greenhouse I applied both my software engineering and AI knowledge by working on MLOps related tasks, setting up core infrastructure for NLP classification models.</p>
